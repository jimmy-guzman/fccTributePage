                        <p class="lead"> Lupe Fiasco, born Wasalu Muhammad Jaco on February 16, 1982 in Chicago, Illinois. When he was in the eight grade, he started rapping his poems; then after hearing Nas' "It Was Written," he pursued hip hop. After meeting gang member Bishop G, he started making mixtapes in his basement. In the beggining of his career, he went by the stage names Little Lu and Lu tha Underdog. His nickname "Lu" came from his mom, due the ending of his first name. "Lupe" came from a high school friend and "Fiasco" came from the song "Firm Fiasco" by The Firm. When he turned 18 he started making music solo, still in his father's basement. At 19, he joing a group called Da Pak but broke up after releasing one single. </p>
                        <blockquote class="gold-text blockquote-reverse"> <em>"We had a song out about cocaine, guns, and women, and I would go to a record store and look at it and think, 'What are you doing?' I felt like a hypocrite. I was acting like this rapper who would never be judged, and I had to destroy that guy. Because what Lupe Fiasco says on this microphone is going to come back to Wasalu Jaco. When the music cuts off, you have to go home and live with what you say." - Lupe Fiasco </em> </blockquote>
                        <p class="lead"> Lupe Fiasco turned away from gangsta rap and developed an admiration for Jay Z and Nas. The Watts Prophets also influenced him. He continued to record music a group and his first self recorded song was "Could Have Been." The song was a turning point in his career since it marked a change in the theme of his music. He eventually signed a solo deal with Arista Records but was fired. He met Jay-Z during that stint, which led to a record deal with Atlantic Records. Prior to his debut solo album, he released a mixtape series "Fahrenheit 1/15. Kanye West invited him to perform on "Touch the Sky", after hearing his version "Diamonds from Sierra Leone" called "Conflict Diamonds". This marked the start of his success which lead to the release of "Kick, Push" from his debut studio album.
